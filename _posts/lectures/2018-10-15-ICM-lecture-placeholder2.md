*Feeling Responsive* shows metadata by default. The default behaviour can be changed via `config.yml`. To show metadata at the end of a page/post just add the following to front matter:
<!--more-->

~~~
show_meta: true
~~~

If you don't want to show metadata, it's simple again:

~~~
show_meta: false
~~~
