Audio classication is to tell the type of a audio file. For example, we can train a system to tell whether a music is a  Beatles song or not, or what is the percentage of similarity.

Please view this Github page for detailed instructions of how to train an use a audio classification using deep learning [Here](https://github.com/SopiMlab/MachineLearningWithAudio/blob/master/Documentation/AudioClassification.md)
