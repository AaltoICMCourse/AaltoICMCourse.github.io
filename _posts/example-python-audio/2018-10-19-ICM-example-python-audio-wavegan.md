WaveGAN is a sound generation system that takes in a big library of sounds and learns to create new examples of it using deep learning. This exercise is an instruction of how to train and use the WaveGAN.

Please view this Github page for detailed instructions [Here](https://github.com/SopiMlab/MachineLearningWithAudio/blob/master/Documentation/UsingWavegan.md)
